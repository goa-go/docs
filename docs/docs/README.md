# Introduction
## What Is Goa?
✨ goa = go + koa

Goa is a middleware-based web framework for golang. Its overall idea comes from [koajs](https://github.com/koajs/koa) and combines the characteristics of golang. Goa is committed to becoming a lighter and more efficient framework in the field of web applications and API development. Instead of bundling any middleware, Goa provides an elegant way to help you write server-side applications quickly and pleasantly.

::: tip Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants
Goa uses many [koajs](https://github.com/koajs/koa) features, and some APIs refer to [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) source code.

Goa-Router is based entirely on the secondary development of [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter), which is highly efficient and low memory usage.
